# Temniy-Prince
A digital platform for manga, light novels, and anime streaming with social features. 
It will be an app with 3 frontends, one for each type of content, one for manga, one for novels etc.
But they will be combine thought the single user account and characters/franchises that are repeated. 
The platform is user driven, so there will be simple users, uploaders (user who have permission to upload new chapters/new titles) and admins.
Each user will have public profiles with library of their titles and each chapter and title will have a tree-like comment section.
For the async jobs: 
1. on each upload of new images or videos we would run async image compression
2. background jobs for notification delivery
